//! Pure scheduling math for live-audio playback (bounded-lookahead skip-ahead).
//!
//! The live-listening playback path schedules each incoming mic chunk onto a
//! Web Audio `AudioContext` at a running cursor (`next_time`). When the WebView
//! is throttled (app backgrounded) the queued chunks burst-replay and the cursor
//! races ahead of the context clock, producing a multi-second playback backlog
//! that keeps sounding after Stop. This helper bounds that: if the cursor has
//! fallen behind the clock (underrun) or run too far ahead of it (backlog), it
//! snaps the cursor back to "now" — the "skip-ahead, never play behind" policy.

/// Default maximum seconds the schedule cursor may lead the context clock before
/// the lead is treated as a backlog to drop. ~0.3 s = a few 80 ms chunks of
/// headroom: enough to absorb normal jitter, small enough to stay perceptibly
/// live.
