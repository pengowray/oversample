//! Automatic Gain Control (AGC) — smooth leveler with limiter.

//! Replaces the old per-chunk adaptive gain with smooth, sample-level

//!
//! Design: a leveler that targets a specific output level (-3 dBFS by default).
//! Quiet signals get boosted, loud signals get reduced, with smooth attack/release
//! envelope following. A noise gate prevents boosting silence, and a hard limiter
//! prevents clipping.
